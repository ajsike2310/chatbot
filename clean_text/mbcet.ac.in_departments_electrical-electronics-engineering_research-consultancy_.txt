Industry-Institute collaboration Initiatives
The Department of EEE has initiated an EV Research cell. For its activities, collaboration with different companies and agencies such as Vydyuthi Energy Services, Charge MOD, Energy Management Centre (EMC) has been initiated. The Research Cell aims to create awareness about e-mobility, EV Technologies and enhance R&D works and career opportunities for faculty and students in this emerging area. Planned activities include internship, workshops, STTPs, project support to the student project groups with support from Faculty, Industrial experts and Domain experts, which may open the base for major projects and research later. The final objective of the cell is to develop an EV model and a charging station in the campus by Faculty and students. Ms. Jomole Joseph was given charge to coordinate the activities and be the Point of Contact with the collaborating industries/Agencies. The team includes Dr. Nisha G K, Ms. Archana A N, Ms. Shilpa George and Mr. Ajish Ashok under the guidance and support of Vice Principal, Prof. Viswanath Rao and Principal, Dr. Abraham T Mathew.
The Institution is paving the path ahead for the students in Electric Vehicles by setting up an Electric Vehicle (EV) Skill Development Lab on the campus as a part of the Kerala Electric Vehicle Community initiative. By promoting EV capacity-building programs among the faculties and students, the college is set to be a role model in the education sector in preparing future graduates to be a #SustainableArmy to fight against climate change. Vydyuthi Energy Services in association with Chargemod delivered an E-Rickshaw for the lab as a part of their EV Community Development Program initiative.
