µLearn: The Skilling Backbone of IEDC
The µLearn Foundation, a GTech initiative, is a futuristic learning ecosystem that blends peer-to-peer learning, community engagement, and digital skilling to cultivate a generation that’s industry-ready, self-driven, and constantly evolving. µLearn is a community-first platform that encourages students and professionals to upskill themselves in a self-paced, structured, and collaborative environment. The core idea is simple — learning should be accessible, enjoyable, and continuous.
What is µLearn?
µLearn MBCET, established in 2022, is the first-ever campus chapter of the µLearn Foundation. Born out of a shared vision to foster consistent upskilling and peer-led learning, this chapter was initiated at Mar Baselios College of Engineering and Technology (MBCET) under Catalyst Mar Baselios IEDC to equip students with industry-relevant skills through a community-first approach.
Why µLearn?
In today’s fast-changing world, traditional education alone is no longer enough. µLearn was created to bridge the gap between academics and industry-ready skills by fostering a culture of self-driven, peer-supported, and interest-based learning.
How µLearn works?
Learn by Doing
: Practical, hands-on tasks that build real-world skills.
Community-Led
: Learn together, grow together — through peer support and learning circles.
Interest-Based
: Explore what you love — from UI/UX to AI/ML, cybersecurity, and beyond.
Karma System
: A gamified learning experience that rewards consistency and contributions.
Industry-Connected
: Backed by GTech and supported by real opportunities like internships, mentorship, and live projects.
Level-Based Growth
: Track your journey and unlock new opportunities as you upskill.
Karma Points
are µLearn’s unique way of tracking your progress and contributions. You earn karma by completing tasks, participating in learning circles, helping peers, and staying consistent. The more karma you earn, the more you unlock perks, gain visibility, and get opportunities like internships, project showcases, and leadership roles.
Your
µID
is your unique identity within the µLearn ecosystem — like your digital learning passport. It tracks your achievements, karma, activity history, and learning journey. Think of it as your portfolio + resume + leaderboard status — all in one.
