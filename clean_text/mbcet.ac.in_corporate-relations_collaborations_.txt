Collaborations
Industry-academia interface has always been under extensive discussions in many ways. The linkage will benefit both the sides. The industries gain from academia through technological innovations through translation of research into products. Students will get opportunities to learn and engage in real-world problem-solving. The industry will find ‘job-ready’ candidates who need less training. It also helps promotion of entrepreneurial skills.
