The facilities include pH meter, Desiccators, Water bath, Hot Air Oven, Muffle Furnace, Spectrophotometer, BOD Incubator, COD Digestor, Conductivity Meter, Naphelometer, Analytical Balance, Electronic Balance, Jar Test Apparatus, Hot Plate, Muffle Furnace, Magnetic Stirrer, etc. It is being planned to have state-of-the-art instruments so as to cater to the needs of the Post Graduate Students and Faculty Members for carrying out Advanced Research and Consultancy Work in the area of Environmental Engineering.
Geology Lab
The Civil Engineering Department is well equipped with a geology lab that showcases various types of rocks, geological maps and various still models. This laboratory helps the students to recognize various earth materials, features, and structures, identification of common rocks and also topographic features.
Departmental Library
The library of the Civil Engineering Department plays a key role in maintaining a vast collection of books related to various streams of Civil Engineering. The Department Library forms the backbone for the advancement of consultation and research work in the department. The library preserves a good collection of text books, reference books, project reports, IS codes, etc. The Department Library works hand in hand with the main library of the College. The facilities available in the Department Library are utilized effectively by the Faculty Members and students.
Seminar Hall
The department has a seminar hall facilitated with the latest technology and well-equipped with multimedia projectors and audio-video amenities, named after the famous architect, Laurie Baker. With a seating capacity of 100, the seminar hall is regularly used for class interactions, meetings, national and international conferences and teacher-student training programs. The back-up facility in the seminar hall enables smooth functioning of seminars and conferences.
Civil Engineering Workshop
The civil engineering workshop acts as the baby steps towards understanding the opportunities of civil engineering. Here the newly admitted students are introduced to the basic concepts of civil engineering by giving hands on experience in setting out of a building, computing the area and volume of various components of buildings, construction of walls, testing of building materials etc.
Plumbing Lab
The Civil Engineering department has a Plumbing Lab set up in association with IPA (Indian Plumbing Association).  The Plumbing Lab aids in providing basic skill training on plumbing technologies and operations to students to enhance their practical knowledge.
