ONGOING CONSULTANCY ACTIVITIES
ORBITAL DEBRIS PROPAGATION AND PROXIMITY AWARENESS
Funded  By : THESPACELABS ,Trivandrum
Principal Investigator: Dr. Ushakumari S.
Co-Investigators: Ms. Elizabeth Varghese and Mr. Aswin. R. B
Research Assistant: Ms. Amala Justin
Research grant: Rs. 2,00,000/-
Project Overview
Orbital debris-defined as any human-made space object orbiting Earth that no longer serves any useful purpose poses a significant and growing hazard for safe spaceflight operations. As the orbital debris poses threats to the live satellites, it is paramount to predict the debris movements around the live satellites. The movements can be predicted if the forces acting on the debris are accurately modeled. The forces like solar pressure, gravity effect due to Sun, Moon and Earth play a vital role for the simulations.
Objectives of the project
Orbital debris propagation modelling
Conjunction analysis
Collision avoidance analysis
Reentry Analysis
Proximity analysis.
