Thankamony.Prof. Thankamony retired from the Environmental Engineering Division, Department of Civil Engineering of College of Engineering Trivandrum in 2010. She also served as a member secretary to the Kerala State Pollution Control Board in 2009. Prof Thankamony’s life as a student and later as a faculty at the College of Engineering Trivandrum has found her green sheen waxing through years. She gathered ecological wisdom from her mother Smt. Devaki Amma.Prof.D. Thankamony began the talk by quoting the following words ” There are enough resources for everybody’s need and not for anybody’s greed” – Mahatma Gandhi.Initially, she talked about carbon footprints – The total amount of greenhouse gases produced to directly and indirectly support human activities usually expressed in equivalent tons of carbon dioxide. Prof. Thankamony expressed her ideologies on water footprints and how we could preserve water. The water footprint measures the amount of water used to produce each of the goods and services we use. It can be measured for a single process, such as – growing rice, for a product such as a pair of jeans, for the fuel we put in our car, or for an entire multinational company. The water footprint also represents how much water is being consumed by a particular country- or globally-in a specific river basin or from an aquifer.She addressed the growing consumers of virtual energy and virtual water. Virtual water content of a product is, the volume of freshwater used to produce the product. It refers to the sum of the water used in the various steps of the production chain. She brought to our notice the amount of water being used to prepare a cup of coffee.She also drew attention to the high energy consumed to produce processed food items and how a big threat it is to our scarce and depleted resources. She also explained what a food mile was. Food mile – It is a term which refers to the distance food is transported from the time of its production, until it reaches the consumers.

Civil Engineering Students Association CESA organised a site visit  to Kallada Dam and associated hydraulic structures- Ottakkal Weir and Pallamvetty Saddle Dam situated in the Thenmala region of Kollam district on 5/10/2024. The site visit was organized with the aim of providing civil engineering students with practical exposure to large-scale water resource management structures. The objective was to understand the design, construction, and operational aspects of key hydraulic structures and the challenges involved in maintaining such critical infrastructure.
Overview of the Structures Visited
a. Kallada Dam
Type:
Concrete and masonry gravity dam
Primary Purpose:
Irrigation, water supply, and hydroelectric power generation
Significance:
The dam plays a crucial role in regulating the water flow of the Kallada River and is integral to the local agricultural and power distribution network.
b. Ottakkal Weir
Function:
Acts as a diversion structure for directing water flow and maintaining controlled distribution to the downstream sections.
Design Highlights:
Incorporates elements that optimize water flow regulation and prevent overflow-related damage during heavy rain periods.
c. Pallamvetty Saddle Dam
Purpose:
An auxiliary dam constructed to support the main dam and control additional water storage.
Role:
Helps manage excess water during peak monsoon periods, ensuring the main dam’s stability and preventing breaches.
The visit provided an invaluable opportunity for civil engineering students to witness complex engineering in action. The experience underscored the practical implications of their coursework and inspired deeper appreciation and interest in hydraulic engineering.
