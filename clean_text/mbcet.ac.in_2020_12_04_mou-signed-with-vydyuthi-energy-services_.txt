On 3rd December 2020, the IET MBCET On Campus crossed a new milestone, with the signing of the MoU between MBCET and Vydyuthi Energy Services for the collaborative venture of IET Outreach 150.
Dr. Abraham T. Mathew, Principal, MBCET and Ms. Indira Babu, MD of Vydyuthi Energy Services exchanged the signed documents marking the start of our collaboration with  alumni start ups towards shaping a better and brighter future.
For celebrating the 150th year of IET, the UK headquarters had opened a Global Engagement Fund asking proposals from all over the world for events pertaining to Sustainability.
Based on that theme, our Student chapter had also submitted a proposal, called the IET Outreach 150. Its an initiative to reachout to the community to extend our skills as well as to learn how the engineering fraternity can make an impact or change, for a better and sustainable living among those in need.
The IET MBCET On Campus proposal on Outreach 150 is one among the 4 that got selected from India.
We are proud to collaborate with Vydyuthi Energy Services (VES) led by its Founder and our Alumnus, Mr. Anoop Babu, (EEE 2003-07) for this venture, as our mutual vision is to work towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
The VES company is listed in United Nations Women Empowerment Program thus ensuring official support of UN in all their activities oriented towards enhancing women capabilities.
The IET MBCET family wholeheartedly thank everyone for their support.
