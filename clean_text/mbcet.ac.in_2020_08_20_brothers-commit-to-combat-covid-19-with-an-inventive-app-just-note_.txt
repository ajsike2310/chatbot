The proliferation of Covid-19 cases has a lot to do with the community spread now. Two brothers, Sreenath and Sreeram came up with an inventive app that notes down the places visited by the user of the app. The app features a division of all the possible destinations or means of travel–public transport, shops, office, etc.– with check-in, check-out system. The user can choose the categorised destination and note down the details. A check-in feature will record the location of the place with the help of GPS. Time will also be recorded simultaneously. The app also provides an option of editing the recorded information later on.
