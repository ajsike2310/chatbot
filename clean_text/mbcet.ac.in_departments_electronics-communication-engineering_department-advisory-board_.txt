Department Advisory Board
The Departmental Advisory Board (DAB) has been framed with the objective of remaining up to date with the latest requirements of the industry and incorporating necessary components in the curriculum as much as possible. The committee develops and recommends new or revised goals and objectives of the programme. The committee also reviews and analyzes the gap between curriculum and Industry requirements and gives necessary feedback or advice actions. The DAB is composed of members from eminent institutions as well as members from industry, alumni and members of faculty of the department.
