IEDC
Catalyst- Mar Baselios IEDC
The Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Centre of Mar Baselios College of Engineering and Technology, Catalyst was inaugurated in the year 2013 with a purpose of inspiring students to become independent engineers by exposing then to the world of Entrepreneurship through Innovation. The Centre aims in sharpening the skills of students, broadening their knowledge base and equipping them with technical and non-technical qualities that an engineer need.
Rather than pushing students to startup, the centre believes in inculcating the entrepreneurial spirit in students. The members have identified the true joy of self-learning and they passionately involve in brining life into their ideas, to solve the problems that they see around. They know the importance of spreading this fire to ignite the minds of their fellow students and hence have dedicated all their work in IEDC for this purpose, besides working on their own individual projects. Catalyst Mar Baselios IEDC aims in helping the students follow their dreams and passion to help them depart MBCET campus not just as engineering graduates, but as real engineers who seek and solve problems.

NATURE CLUB
NATURE CLUB (PRAKRUTHI)
“The Greatest Threat to Nature is to believe that someone else will save it.”
Realizing this, “Prakruthi”, the Nature club of Mar Baselios College of Engineering and Technology has always been committed in sensitizing the students on issues related to Environment.

YOGA Club
YOGA CLUB
“Yoga is the journey of the self through the self to the self”.
Yoga has been gaining immense popularity due to the short-term as well as long-term benefits that it provides. The aims of the yoga enthusiasts are extremely varied. Some are particularly inspired by the spiritual element that yoga provides; others by the increased fitness and flexibility that it results in. Some people find solutions to suffering from varied health disorders and there are others who achieve an all-round development of a calm-stress free mind and a fit body.
Our college proudly supports yoga through club activities. Hours a day sitting at desk or more hours doing homework cause a young body to tense up. Social and family pressures and unfortunately, anxiety, abuse and bullying also take their toll. Stress is a major obstacle to academic achievement, and yoga’s stress relief powers have been shown to boost student performance.
Yoga and Meditation club in our college has its activities going on actively. Club conducts the activities once in a week. The activity includes theoretical, practical classes and convey knowledge about importance of yoga and meditation under the guidance of trained teachers who has about 10 years of experience. While we may speak different languages and come from different states, our problems and questions about life are similar. Modern science has made great strides in helping us improve our standard of living, it has lacked in a holistic approach to help people overcome pain in life and gain lasting happiness. Each of us are on a spiritual journey with life lessons to learn. For those of us who are conscious of spiritual journey and want to progress spiritually, yoga and meditation club would like to help by providing you with a road map so that you can make the best use of every precious moment of your life.
Yoga and Meditation club activity have been conducted weekly one hour. Which includes Meditations, Pranayama- a process of directing energy in our body, Yoga postures and Sooryanamaskara. Yoga is not a religion; it is a way of living that aims towards a healthy mind in a healthy body.
