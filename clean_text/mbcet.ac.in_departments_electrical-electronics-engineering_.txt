Department is catering to the needs of moulding Engineers in one of the prime and emerging fields that emphasize the fundamental concepts of  the Electrical Power Engineering comprising the topics of Power systems, Power Electronics and Drives. The basic skills are augmented with a blend of knowledge in Control and Industrial Automation, Electronics, Integrated Circuits, Communication Engineering, Computer Technology and so on. There are two undergraduate programmes and one postgraduate programme. These programmes are approved by the AICTE and are affiliated to the APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University.
The infrastructure and lab facilities are continuously upgraded to provide adequate opportunities for the students to learn and innovate. The Faculty enable our students to apply critical thinking and problem-solving skills in the academics as well as the real life situations through a well curated teaching and training approach. They gain practical experience by working in the well equipped Laboratories of the Department such as Power Systems Lab, Analog and Digital Circuits Lab, Systems and Control Lab, Power Electronics Lab, Electrical Machines Lab, Power Control and Drives Lab and the Computer Aided Design Labs.
Numerous placement offers through On-campus placements and off-campus recruitment in the IT Sector and core industries are available. Active involvement of students in Professional bodies such as IET, IEEE, IEEE PES, SEEM, ISTE etc provide amble opportunities for students to tone up their skills and communication abilities. It is a matter of great privilege and honour to mention about Electric Vehicle Research Cell which is being developed with the help of Alumni. The IEDC is facilitating the conversion of ideas to prototypes and the Energy Audit Cell equips the students with the skills of energy conservation through energy audit. Such avenues for tinkering with ideas enable and encourage students to research in emerging areas and come up with innovations.  Department is also helping the students to go for Internships at KSEB, KELTRON, TELK, Airport Authority of India, Haltech Switchgears, etc. so as to utilize the holidays and semester breaks well.
