The library is equipped with a good number of text books and reference books in Computer Science and IT fields. The records of industrial training reports, university question papers, reports of seminars and projects are kept in the library and made accessible to students. The students can refer books and have access to Science Direct, IEEE digital libraries of computer science online journals from the department library. The library serves to provide a calm and cozy ambience conductive to long hours of study.\nThe department library repository includes:\n1\nText Books on subject relevant areas\n2\nMagazines and newspapers\n3\nJournals\n4\nProceedings of  conferences\n5\nLab Manuals\n6\nSample Lab Records\n7\nMini Project Reports\n8\nProject Reports\n9\nSeminar Reports\nTotal No. of Titles:\n325\nWorking Hours:\nOn all working days:\nFrom 9.15 am to 4:35 pm\nRules and Regulations:\nStudents can enter into the department only during break time or in the allotted period for the library.
