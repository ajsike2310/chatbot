MBCET fulfils this innate desire, for those who wish, through the St. Basil’s Chapel. Erected in the shape of a bell, under the Buddhist influence by the Founder, it offers a centre for quiet worship and meditation for all. The chapel leads us to discover and explore authentic avenues by which we glorify God. The Jesus Youth MBCET wing conducts regular prayer meetings. Every year a short term Yoga course is conducted besides the Yes! + Course under the Art of Living Programme.\nNursing Station\nLibrary\nITMS\nHostel\nTransportation\nCanteen\nAmenities Center\nGymnasium\nChapel\nMaintenance Cell\nCells and Groups\nEnvironment Management Cell\nWaste Management Cell\nCentral Computing Facility\nConference Halls\nANNOUNCEMENTS\nExam Notifications\nNew\nM.Tech Admissions 2025\nNew\nB.
