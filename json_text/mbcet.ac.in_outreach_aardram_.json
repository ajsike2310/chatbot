The S3 mechanical students of MBCET have risen, not just as engineers of the future, but as responsible citizens of today, under the banner of ‘Aardram’.\nTheir journey started on the beaches of Kerala, home to a heart-wrenching paradox – breathtaking natural beauty marred by the carelessness of its own people. The beaches, overrun with plastic and waste, bore the brunt of increasing tourism and the apathy of those who were supposed to be their caretakers. But Aardram stepped in, turning this tragedy into an opportunity for change.\nOn February 26th, as the sun painted the sky in hues of orange and purple, 35 students embarked on a mission to reclaim the beauty of Vettucaud beach. Armed with gloves and determination, they collected, separated, and responsibly disposed of the waste, leaving behind a cleaner, safer beach. They even creatively repurposed the recyclable plastic into a green facade and bottle stand, showcasing the potential of waste when viewed through the lens of sustainability.\nThe club’s journey did not stop there. On 29th July 2022, Aardram was officially recognized as a charity club of MBCET, with its logo launched amidst music, dance, and heartfelt speeches. Their mission? To extend a hand of solace to those in distress, to be a beacon of hope for the needy, and to instill a spirit of service among their peers.\nThen came the celebration of India’s Independence Day. A day filled with pride, patriotism, and unity, where the tricolor flag was hoisted, stirring speeches were delivered, and the melodies of the music club echoed through the campus. Each department participated with fervor, culminating in a grand procession and an award ceremony for the best performers.\nAardram’s journey is more than a series of events. It is an inspiring tale of change, of students stepping up to shoulder responsibilities that extend beyond textbooks and classrooms. Their efforts are a testament to the power of compassion and unity, showing us that we are not powerless against the challenges our society faces.\nFrom cleaning beaches to launching a charity club, the students of Aardram have shown that change begins with a single step. It begins with acknowledging our role as stewards of the planet and caretakers of our fellow beings. Today, they are not just students – they are change-makers, leading by example and inspiring others to follow.\nLet their journey inspire each of us to look beyond ourselves, to recognize the power we hold, and to use it for the betterment of our society. After all, every wave of change begins with a single ripple. Let’s be that ripple. Let’s be Aardram.\nANNOUNCEMENTS\nExam Notifications\nNew\nM.Tech Admissions 2025\nNew\nB.
