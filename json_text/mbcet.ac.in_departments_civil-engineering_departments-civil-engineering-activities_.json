She also served as a member secretary to the Kerala State Pollution Control Board in 2009. Prof Thankamony’s life as a student and later as a faculty at the College of Engineering Trivandrum has found her green sheen waxing through years. She gathered ecological wisdom from her mother Smt. Devaki Amma.Prof.D. Thankamony began the talk by quoting the following words ” There are enough resources for everybody’s need and not for anybody’s greed” – Mahatma Gandhi.Initially, she talked about carbon footprints – The total amount of greenhouse gases produced to directly and indirectly support human activities usually expressed in equivalent tons of carbon dioxide. Prof. Thankamony expressed her ideologies on water footprints and how we could preserve water. The water footprint measures the amount of water used to produce each of the goods and services we use. It can be measured for a single process, such as – growing rice, for a product such as a pair of jeans, for the fuel we put in our car, or for an entire multinational company. The water footprint also represents how much water is being consumed by a particular country- or globally-in a specific river basin or from an aquifer.She addressed the growing consumers of virtual energy and virtual water. Virtual water content of a product is, the volume of freshwater used to produce the product. It refers to the sum of the water used in the various steps of the production chain. She brought to our notice the amount of water being used to prepare a cup of coffee.She also drew attention to the high energy consumed to produce processed food items and how a big threat it is to our scarce and depleted resources.
