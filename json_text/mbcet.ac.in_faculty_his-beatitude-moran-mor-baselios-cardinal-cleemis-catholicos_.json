This College has been established with a sublime objective, namely to provide quality technical education based on fundamental human values. As the motto of the College ‘Duc In Altum’, very well depicts what we aim at is something more than the ordinary and the mediocre, without at the same time compromising on values. We wish to reach out to all sections of our society without the distinction of caste, creed, etc. In short, Mar Baselios College Of Engineering And Technology is envisaged to be a glowing example of the philosophy of education and the apostolate of human resource development which the Major Archdiocese of Trivandrum has been pursuing for the last Eight Decades. The Major Archdiocese has every reason to be proud of the quality and greatness of the service that this Institution is providing to the society and of its potential in radically transforming our society for a better tomorrow. We are sure, thousands of young men and women will come out of this Institution, fully equipped to contribute their valuable share in the great mission of Nation-building. My wish and prayer is that the College may live upto the great dreams of its Founders and be an agent of social transformation.\nANNOUNCEMENTS\nExam Notifications\nNew\nM.Tech Admissions 2025\nNew\nB.
