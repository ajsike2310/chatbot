<p>For the First time in Kerala, ASME MBCET CHAPTER in association with The FMAE ( Fraternity of Mechanical and Automotive Engineers) organized a national level Training program – ‘ATV bike Design  and Development’; a 15 day  intense training from 4<sup>th</sup> to 17<sup>th</sup>of July 2017 that covers all the  aspects of automobile manufacturing, from design to fabrication.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2841" src="https://mbcet.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ASME2-1.png" alt="" width="293" height="178" /><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2842" src="https://mbcet.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ASME3.png" alt="" width="299" height="178" /></p>
<p>The Outcome of this program is to make the participants aware of the road ahead of them and to give them prior experience of what they are going to encounter when they are in an industry.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2843" src="https://mbcet.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ASME4.png" alt="" width="293" height="199" /><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2844" src="https://mbcet.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ASME5.png" alt="" width="288" height="198" /></p>
<p>The Chapter is yet again proud to represent the college at the international event ASME E-FEST Asia Pacific 2018 in Delhi, in the month of March (16<sup>th</sup> -18<sup>th</sup>), 2018. Student members, Harikrishnan Jayan Menon (S8), Bharath Lal (S8) and Edwin Denis Joseph (S8) represented the college in the Old Guard Competition.</p>
<p>The unit has also organised a Mind Controlled Autobot Workshop, the first of its kind at the college on 24<sup>th</sup> – 25<sup>th</sup> March 2018. The workshop was conducted by ROBOKART, Bangalore in association with IIT Bombay Innovation Cell. It was the first ever workshop in the history of all ASME chapters in Kerala to conduct a 3-in-1 workshop, i.e., Mind – Voice – Android App controlled Autobot.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2845" src="https://mbcet.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ASME6.png" alt="" width="274" height="187" /><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2846" src="https://mbcet.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ASME7.png" alt="" width="294" height="187" /></p>
<p>It was basically an Arduino Board based design. A brainwave-reading headset which has only a single lead electrode (Neurosky mind wave headset) was used to collect the EEG signal. The EEG signal developed was then sent to the Arduino Mega to control the movement of the robot. This was indeed a novel experience for the students in making robot from scratch. These methods are one of the leading technologies under research hence the workshop without a doubt equipped the participants with necessary basic details to get started with the field.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2847" src="https://mbcet.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ASME8.png" alt="" width="285" height="210" /><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2848" src="https://mbcet.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ASME9-300x210.png" alt="" width="300" height="210" /></p>
<p>A membership drive for the first year students was also conducted. An inspiring speech was delivered by the Vice Chairperson, Harikrishnan Jayan Menon, S8 on the growing need of the youth to think outside of the textbooks and explore on their own in order to develop the skills required for an engineer in today’s fast moving world.</p>
<p>The ASME MBCET Chapter continues to grow and expand its roots. The chapter is expected to reach heights in the future and looks forward to let its members come out with flying colours.</p>
