<p>The Department of Civil Engineering, in association with the Civil Engineering Students Association (CESA), organized a technical talk on <strong>&#8220;GATEWAY TO IIT&#8221;</strong> on 31st January 2025 from 8:00 to 9:00 PM in online mode. The session was led by <strong>Ms. Famy S. Maheen,</strong> a Research Scholar at IIT Bombay. It aimed to provide strategies, preparation techniques, and insider tips to crack the <strong>GATE exam</strong>, along with guidance on selecting the right <strong>IIT and specialization.</strong> The event was coordinated by <strong>Ms. Indhu Luke,</strong> Assistant Professor, Civil department. A total of <strong>28 students</strong> from UG and PG sections actively participated in the session.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sessions on Career Orientation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CESA, Civil Engineering Students Association MBCET successfully organized two career-oriented sessions for students, aimed at guiding the students towards professional growth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first session, <em>Civil Engineering Competitive Exams Orientation</em>, was conducted on March 11, 2025, from 10:35 AM to 11:35 AM for the eighth-semester civil engineering students. The session was led by Civilianz, Trivandrum, a reputed institute specializing in coaching for civil engineering competitive exams. The speakers provided detailed insights into various national and state-level competitive exams, including GATE, ESE, and PSC. They discussed exam patterns, preparation strategies, and career opportunities in government and public sector undertakings. The interactive session allowed students to address their queries and gain clarity on their career prospects in the civil engineering domain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second session, <em>Management Education Orientation</em>, was held on March 19, 2025, from 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM for sixth-semester civil engineering students. Conducted by TIME Institute, Trivandrum, the session focused on the importance of management education for engineers. Experts from TIME introduced students to various MBA entrance exams, such as CAT, MAT, and XAT, and explained how pursuing an MBA can open doors to diverse career opportunities in project management, consultancy, and entrepreneurship.

<p><strong>TALK ON &#8220;PERSONAL FOOTPRINTS”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Civil Engineering Students Association (CESA) in association with Nature club , Mar Baselios College Of Engineering And Technology organized a talk on &#8220;Personal Footprints &#8221; , on the 25th of August, 2016. The event consisted of a talk on personal footprints by the esteemed professor, Prof. D. Thankamony.Prof. Thankamony retired from the Environmental Engineering Division, Department of Civil Engineering of College of Engineering Trivandrum in 2010. She also served as a member secretary to the Kerala State Pollution Control Board in 2009. Prof Thankamony&#8217;s life as a student and later as a faculty at the College of Engineering Trivandrum has found her green sheen waxing through years. She gathered ecological wisdom from her mother Smt. Devaki Amma.Prof.D. Thankamony began the talk by quoting the following words &#8221; There are enough resources for everybody&#8217;s need and not for anybody&#8217;s greed&#8221; &#8211; Mahatma Gandhi.Initially, she talked about carbon footprints &#8211; The total amount of greenhouse gases produced to directly and indirectly support human activities usually expressed in equivalent tons of carbon dioxide. Prof. Thankamony expressed her ideologies on water footprints and how we could preserve water. The water footprint measures the amount of water used to produce each of the goods and services we use. It can be measured for a single process, such as &#8211; growing rice, for a product such as a pair of jeans, for the fuel we put in our car, or for an entire multinational company. The water footprint also represents how much water is being consumed by a particular country- or globally-in a specific river basin or from an aquifer.She addressed the growing consumers of virtual energy and virtual water. Virtual water content of a product is, the volume of freshwater used to produce the product. It refers to the sum of the water used in the various steps of the production chain. She brought to our notice the amount of water being used to prepare a cup of coffee.She also drew attention to the high energy consumed to produce processed food items and how a big threat it is to our scarce and depleted resources. She also explained what a food mile was. Food mile &#8211; It is a term which refers to the distance food is transported from the time of its production, until it reaches the consumers.</p>

<p><strong>UTBHAV &#8217;16</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Utbhav is the annual technical fest of the Department of Civil Engineering, MBCET. Over the years, Utbhav has witnessed students pouring in from all parts of India, thronging to participate in the various events conducted. The events test the skills vital for the civil engineer of today, right from technical aptitude to managerial skills.Utbhav &#8217;16 comes with the motto &#8216; VAISHVIK LAKSHYAH &#8216; [ Global Goals ] -BUILD WITH EARTH. The event is conducted on 26 th of February. The event is based upon the United Nations 15 year plan named Global Goals-for sustainable development. The Global Goals aims to achieve 3 extra ordinary things in the next 15 years ; end extreme poverty, fight inequality and injustice, fix climatic changes for which 17 goals has been set up by the UN. Out of which 8 goals are chosen to analyse,implement and publicize in a regional level. the outcome of the programme is to achieve solution to problems that hinder sustainable social development and bring about socially committed engineers.</p>

<p><strong>METAMORPHOSIS 2015</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A short term course on the final phase in metamorphosis of civil engineering students was conducted for the outgoing Civil Engineering students during 19 to 23rd of May 2015. One can very well foresee the frustration of the fresh engineering graduates when they enter into the professional field. They may not be in a position to correlate what they grasp in the class and what they have to deliver in the field. The programme under this short term course was devised to have a smooth transition from the class room to the field of work. It is so planned to familiarize them with different demanding sectors of Civil Engineering profession. In conclusion all engineering students with Civil Engineering background can make the best use of the lectures delivered by eminent personalities with hands on experience in the field of Civil Engineering and grasp the practical side from the field trips and site visits arranged.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">ASCE MBCET has celebrated the World Water Day 2023 with the active participation of the students. The theme of this year is ‘<strong>ACCELERATING CHANGE</strong>’, be the change you want to see the world. The importance of the theme and how relevant the issue is discussed and an awareness regarding the same was given in class. The students were grouped to different teams and organized two sets of activities which included WWD Campaign and Water for birds. The Campaign included the collection of data regarding the overflow of taps and the leakages of pipes and taps that has been located all around the campus. Water for birds included serving water for them in mud pots and coconut shells in different areas of the campus. This activity was included for ensuring that birds get water to drink in this hot season. It was filled and removed from time to time for ensuring the proper safety and no other harmful substances are filled in it by any natural agents. Students were happy and enthusiastic to do such activities.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We Indians are proud about our talented youngsters, leaving a mark in various levels of sports including the Olympic games. But often, the able-bodied athlete with ideal body, is thought of as a pillar of strength, of someone who is admired. We dedicate Utbhav 2k18, to remember and honour those people, disabled by strength, but abled by their willpower, the real heroes of sports. The fund we raise and the profit obtained by this fest will go to THANAL, the charitable organisation run by the civil department, from where it will reach the rightful and felicitous athletes. Let&#8217;s honour them, the people who gave their strength and life to the field of sports.</p>
