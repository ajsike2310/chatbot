<p><strong>HANDS-ON WORKSHOP on PYTHON PROGRAMMING by UST</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Department of Computer Science and Engineering, MBCET, in association with UST, organized a five days hands-on workshop on Python programming from October 9 to 13, 2023. The event aimed to empower participants with essential Python skills, catering to both beginners and intermediate-level programmers. 50 students of third semester from  the departments of CS, AI, EL and ME .participated. The workshop commenced with a comprehensive overview of Python, its syntax, and key features. Participants were introduced to the versatility of Python as a programming language. In addition, the workshop focussed on equipping attendees with practical skills in developing user interfaces using Python and integrating them seamlessly with MongoDB—a popular NoSQL database.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The workshop featured seasoned speakers with expertise in Python UI development and MongoDB. Mr. Sthanu Kumar Ramakrishnan Thambi (UST, IN) kicked off the workshop with the basics of Python programming language and it’s  capabilities in UI developmentThe sessions focused on layout design, event handling, and integrating functionality into the UI. Participants were introduced to the popular Tkinter framework, gaining hands-on experience through interactive coding exercises. Mr. Thomas George Koshy, an expert in database management, introduced participants to MongoDB—an open-source NoSQL database. The highlight of the workshop was the session on integrating the Python UI developed earlier with MongoDB. Participants learned how to establish a connection, perform CRUD operations, and ensure a seamless flow of data between the UI and the database. The workshop received overwhelmingly positive feedback from participants. Many expressed appreciations for the hands-on nature of the sessions, citing it as a valuable opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting. Following the workshop, an industrial visit is scheduled to UST for all the 50 participants on October 20, 2023.</p>
