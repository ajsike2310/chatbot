<li><strong>INDUSTRY 4.0 &#8211; TOWARDS EMBEDDED FUTURE</strong>We stand on the verge of a new age technological revolution that will alter the fundamental way we think, act, relate and communicate. The buzz is around Mobile Supercomputing, Intelligent robots, Self-driving cars, Neuro-technological brain enhancements, Genome editing and its business disruptions. The evidence of dramatic change is all around us and its happening at exponential speed. The key is to up-skill and re-skill relentlessly to stay relevant in the futuristic world. With this objective in mind, Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering in association with The Catalyst- Mar Baselios Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Centre (IEDC) organized a five-day workshop on embedded and futuristic technologies that are spearheading the wave of Fourth Industrial Revolution.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1853" src="https://mbcet.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/77.png" alt="" width="1040" height="487" srcset="https://mbcet.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/77.png 1040w, https://mbcet.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/77-300x140.png 300w, https://mbcet.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/77-768x360.png 768w, https://mbcet.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/77-1024x480.png 1024w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1040px) 100vw, 1040px" />45 faculty members from various engineering as well as polytechnic colleges acrossthe state participated in the 5-day event. The event was coordinated by Ms. Anu Susan Philip and Mr. Arun J. S, Assistant professors in Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering. B’ hub and Destination Kerala associated as Knowledge and Magazine partners respectively.<br />
During the inaugural session, Head of the Department, Dr. M. J. Jayashree delivered the welcome speechfor the participants in the presence of Bursar Fr. John Vilayil, Principal Dr. T. M. George and Vice Principal Prof. S. Viswanatha Rao. She introduced the objective of the event and also mentioned the importance of adapting with the technological changes so as to stay relevant in the era of fourth industrial revolution.<br />
The idea of the whole event was to create a solid exposure in the emerging futuristic technologies which will drive the interest of academia from novice to expert level. The contents were organized top-down where we start with a use case and develop it downwards into its technical details, which turned out to be a very effective model to entice the audience. While Dr. Dilip Thomas brought in an absolute revelation in convolutional neural networks and how AI is going to dominate so many existing jobs very soon, Mr. Jeril depicted how virtual reality is becoming a parallel reality which enables mankind to physically interact with digital information. Mr. Senthil Kumar delivered a splendid session on his transformational journey from employee to entrepreneur. The way he crafted a solution for his pregnant sister’s vital statistics measurement and made the doctor to diagnose remotely was very inspiring. He also delivered an incredible activity-oriented session where he made participants to enact as the basic elements of an IoT network, which created absolute clarity regarding the backend operation. The CTO incubations team from the Innovation lab of Tata Consultancy Services engaged the audience with their live drone session and RADA-the robot that uses AI to assist customers, address their queries and entertain them which isdeployed by the team in Delhi International airport. Mr. Jithin Krishnan gave an insight on the assistive implants and the possibilities &amp;revolution that is going to happen with the convergence of medical and engineering streams.<br />
The sessions concluded on 20 July 2018 with the valedictory session presided by Vice Principal of MBCET, Prof. S. Viswanatha Rao. He also gave away the participants certificate along with Dr. M. J. Jayashree.</li>
