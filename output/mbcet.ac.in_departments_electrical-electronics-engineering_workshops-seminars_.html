<p><strong>FDP ON ROBOTICS CONTROL AND APPLICATIONS – PHASE I (IROBO ’22)</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Coordinators: Dr. Shalu George K., Ms. Archana A. N.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The Faculty Development Programme on Robotics Control and Applications – Phase I (IROBO ’22) was organized by the Department of Electrical &amp; Electronics, Engineering, Mar Baselios College of Engineering &amp; Technology Trivandrum from 4<sup> </sup>to 8 April 2022. Due to the Covid’19 pandemic situations, the FDP was conducted in online mode through Google Meet.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Robotics is a branch of engineering that involves the conception, design, manufacture and operation of robots. The objective of the robotics field is to create intelligent machines that can assist humans in a variety of ways. A robot may resemble a human, or it may be in the form of a robotic application, such as robotic process automation (RPA), which simulates how humans engage with software to perform repetitive, rules-based tasks. While the field of robotics and exploration of the potential uses and functionality of robots have grown substantially in the 20th century, the idea is certainly not a new one. Today, industrial robots, as well as many other types of robots, are used to perform repetitive tasks. They may take the form of a robotic arm, robotic exoskeleton or traditional humanoid robots. Industrial robots and robot arms are used by manufacturers and warehouses, such as those owned by Amazon, Devol, Best Buy and more. To function, a combination of computer programming and algorithms, a remotely controlled manipulator, actuators, control systems &#8211; action, processing and perception &#8211; real-time sensors and an element of automation helps to inform what a robot or robotic system does.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The objective of this programme is to provide an opportunity to acquire knowledge about the basics of Robotics, Kinematics and Dynamics of Robots and also about mobile robots. This course was also aimed at offering a unique opportunity to faculty, research scholars and academicians, working in the relevant topics in Robotics to come closer. The FDP has been planned to be conducted in two or three phases, with next phases covering the different types of Control of Robots and its applications, which would help research scholars to identify the problem definitions in the area and thus facilitate research in the field of robotics.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The programme was inaugurated online on 4<sup>th</sup> April 2022 at 2.00 p.m. by Dr. Abraham T. Mathew, Principal, MBCET and delivered the inaugural address. Dr. Shalu George K<strong>, </strong>Co-ordinator of the FDP welcomed all the dignitaries, participants and the in-house staff. The felicitation was given by Dr. Nisha G K, HOD, Dept. of EEE.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">After inauguration the first session was on “Introduction to Robotics and its Applications” by Ms. Shyju Susan Mathew, Assistant Professor, Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, MBCET.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">On the second day (05/04/2022) the session was handled by Dr. Dr. Jisha V. R., Professor Department of Electrical Engineering, College of Engineering, Trivandrum on the topic “Kinematics of Robots”.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">On the third day (06/04/2022), the session was handled by Dr. Jobin Varghese, Associate Professor and HoD, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Eranad Knowledge City Technical Campus, Manjeri, Malappuram on the topic “Dynamics of Robots”.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Dr. Sreekanth M., CEO, Kabani Tech., Shoranur handled the session on fourth day, on the topic “Shape Memory Alloys: An alternative to conventional actuators”.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">On the fifth day (08/04/22), the session was on “Mobile Robots” by Mr. Anurag Reghu, Co-Founder and Director, Trizlabz, Ernakulam.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Feedback link was circulated to participants at the end of each session. An assessment test was also conducted on the last day of the FDP.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sequential Faculty Development Programme (SFDP) on “Electrical Systems Design”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Department of EEE has initiated a new venture to enhance the teaching capabilities of Engineering College teachers. The first of the series is on the subject ‘<strong>Electrical Systems Design</strong>’, a core subject in the eighth semester Electrical &amp; Electronics branch. The revised syllabus (<strong>2013 scheme of Kerala University</strong>) of Electrical Systems Design covers several new features of Electrical systems design. The non availability of adequate printed literature and the over dependence on statutory documents, has made it difficult for the teachers to teach the subject effectively. In the light of this, the Department of Electrical &amp; Electronics Engineering, MBCET is organizing a <strong>Sequential Training Programme on Electrical Systems Design</strong>. The course content is primarily concentrating on the 8th semester syllabus content of the University of Kerala. Certainly this would be a good opportunity for the faculty members who are teaching this subject during the current semester to enhance and enrich their knowledge in this area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The resource persons include experts from industry under the leadership of <strong>Prof M K Giridharan</strong>, Dean (Academics), MBCET who is the author of Electrical System Design books which are included as references by Kerala University. The FDP was held from 28th January to 8th April, 2017. Participants include faculties from Government colleges as well.</p>
